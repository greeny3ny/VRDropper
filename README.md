# VRDropper

To start, walk through the teleporter!
Stay on the platforms for as long as possible before they break and you fall to your dooooooooooooooooooooom.

Reset button is MODS only (for now).
Refresh button is local - if the app is not updating, click this!

- Tiles crack as you walk on them
- If you stay on a tile for too long, it will crack

TO DO:
 - Some form of teams maybe?
